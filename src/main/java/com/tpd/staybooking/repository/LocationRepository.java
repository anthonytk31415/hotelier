/*
 * @Repository Annotation:
 * The @Repository annotation is often used in Spring to indicate that a class
 * is a repository, which is a type of
 * Spring component responsible for handling database interactions. Repositories
 * typically provide methods for querying
 * and manipulating data in a database, making it easier to work with database
 * operations in a more abstract and convenient manner.
 * 
 * LocationRepository Interface:
 * This interface is meant to define methods for interacting with data stored in
 * Elasticsearch, specifically for the Location entity.
 * The methods defined here will allow you to perform various operations on the
 * Elasticsearch index associated with the Location class.
 * 
 * ElasticsearchRepository<Location, Long>:
 * This is an extension of the ElasticsearchRepository interface provided by
 * Spring Data Elasticsearch. It's a generic interface
 * that helps with common Elasticsearch operations. The ElasticsearchRepository
 * interface has methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
 * Delete) operations and other common queries on Elasticsearch indexes.
 * 
 * Location: This is the entity class type that the repository is dealing with
 * (in this case, the Location class).
 * Long: This is the type of the identifier used by the entity class (id field
 * in the Location class is of type Long).
 * 
 * CustomLocationRepository: --> You need to extend to implement the search.
 * This seems to be a custom interface or repository that extends beyond the
 * basic operations provided by ElasticsearchRepository.
 * It's not part of the standard Spring Data Elasticsearch naming conventions,
 * so it's likely defined elsewhere in your codebase.
 * By extending this interface, the LocationRepository gains access to
 * additional custom methods that might be specific to your application's
 * requirements.
