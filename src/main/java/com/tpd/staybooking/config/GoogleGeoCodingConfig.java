The GoogleGeoCodingConfig configuration class is responsible for creating a bean of type GeoApiContext using the provided Google API key.

/*
 * Google Cloud API Key:
 * Google Cloud APIs, such as the Google Maps Geocoding API, require an API key
 * for authentication and access control.
 * This API key is provided by Google Cloud when you create a project and enable
 * the necessary APIs.
 * 
 * Application Properties:
 * Application properties are configuration settings that can be externalized
 * from the code.
 * They allow you to configure various aspects of your application without
 * modifying the code directly.
 * In the provided code, the application property geocoding.apikey is used to
 * store the Google Cloud API key for geocoding.
 * 
 * Dependency Injection:
 * Dependency injection is a design pattern used in Spring and other frameworks.
 * It allows you to provide dependencies
 * (such as objects or values) to a class rather than having the class create
 * them itself. In the context of the provided code,
 * dependency injection is used to inject the Google Cloud API key into the
 * GoogleGeoCodingConfig configuration class.
 * 
 * Configuration Class (GoogleGeoCodingConfig):
 * The GoogleGeoCodingConfig class is annotated with @Configuration, making it a
 * Spring configuration class.
 * It defines a method geoApiContext() that is annotated with @Bean. This method
 * creates and configures a bean of type GeoApiContext,
 * which is part of the Google Maps Java Client library.
 * 
 * @Value("${geocoding.apikey}") injects the value of the geocoding.apikey
 * property from the application's configuration properties.
 * This means that the Google Cloud API key is injected into the apiKey field of
 * the configuration class.
 * The geoApiContext() method builds a GeoApiContext instance using the injected
 * API key. This context is used to interact with
 * Google Maps Geocoding services.
 * 
 * Interaction Flow:
 * When the application starts, Spring reads the application properties to find
 * the value of geocoding.apikey.
 * The GoogleGeoCodingConfig configuration class is processed by Spring, and the
 * apiKey field is injected with the API key value from the properties.
 * When the geoApiContext() bean method is called, it creates a GeoApiContext
 * instance with the provided API key.
 * Other parts of the application can use dependency injection to obtain the
 * configured GeoApiContext bean and use it to interact with
 * Google Maps Geocoding services.
 * 
 * In summary, the provided GoogleGeoCodingConfig configuration class acts as a
 * bridge between the Google Cloud API key,
 * application properties, and the application's code. It uses dependency
 * injection to inject the API key from application properties
 * into a GeoApiContext bean, which can then be used across the application to
 * interact with Google Maps Geocoding services.
 * This approach keeps sensitive configuration like API keys separate from the
 * application code and promotes modularity and reusability.
