     * doFilterInternal Method:
     * This method is the core of the CORS filter and is invoked for each incoming
     * request.
     * It sets the following CORS-related headers in the response:
     * Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This header specifies which origins are allowed
     * to access the resource.
     * In this case, it's set to "*" to allow any origin. You can replace "*" with a
     * specific origin if you
     * want to restrict access to a particular domain.
     * 
     * Access-Control-Allow-Methods: This header lists the HTTP methods that are
     * allowed for the resource.
     * In this case, it allows methods like POST, GET, OPTIONS, and DELETE.
     * Access-Control-Allow-Headers: This header defines which headers can be
     * included in the request.
     * It allows headers like Authorization and Content-Type.
     * 
     * If the incoming request method is OPTIONS (a pre-flight request sent by the
     * browser to check CORS permissions),
     * the response status is set to HttpServletResponse.SC_OK (200 OK) without
     * passing the request to the filter chain. This effectively handles the
     * pre-flight request.
     * For non-OPTIONS requests, the filter chain is invoked by calling
     * filterChain.doFilter(httpServletRequest,
     * httpServletResponse). This allows the request to proceed to its destination,
     * such as a controller method.
